                    <p class='storytext'>Whatever the cause was, Apollo and Atlas were late, but they still made it. The room fell silent after Apollo's exclamation and was followed by a suggestion from Dusty.</p>
                    <p class='speak dusty'>Dusty: So that means we can finally see what's inside the box right?</p>
                    <p class='speak aegis'>Aegis: Yup, everyone is here.</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>Atlas shut the door behind him and walked with Apollo to the table which Aegis was setting the box on. The box was made out of cardboard which was weird because Aegis claimed it was in the middle of a crater which would logically burn it up. The table was round and could fit every member of the group. It was often used for board games or big Lego projects. But today it was to look at what was inside this cardboard box. The table was sorrounded by familiar but differing faces, from excited, scared, intrigued, to annoyed. The truth was everyone here was dying to see what this was about.</p>
                    <p class='speak aegis'>Aegis: Who wants to open it?</p>
                    <p class='speak atlas'>Atlas: You found it, it's only right that you open it.</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>Aegis looked around for approval and was pleased to see his friends nodding. This was it. He opened the box and took out what was inside.</p>
