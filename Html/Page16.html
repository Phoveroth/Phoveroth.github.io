                    <p class='storytext'>The next few hours were spent on creating tens of magical items, with combination of different buttons, prompts and ideas. Everyone seemed bound to a button, Alp to the red slit, Apollo to the sun, Dusty to the blue wind marks, Pel to the purple mask, Coy to the red gear, Eri to the black and white spiral, Aegis to the yellowish white wings, Joseph to the skull, however Tarda and Atlas were bound to the same symbol, the green beyblade. And it seemed that with every magic item created with the same symbols, they carried some sort of meaning. Whenever the sun was used to create an item, the item carried the properties of either being illuminating or being related to luck and so on. The group was still in the process of figuring out which symbol did what and how the machine knew what to do. Apollo quickly got into logging every magical item and their properties so that he could figure out more about the machine and here are some of the best ones.</p>
