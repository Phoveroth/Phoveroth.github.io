                    <p class='storytext'>This light was more bright? It had a more yellow tint then the one before, not like anyone would notice, because they were busy closing their eyes so that they didn't go blind. The light faded and left the inside of the machines top part simmering like freshly cooked food, leaving trails of smoke. And in the middle, stood a slot machine that was made of gold.</p>
                    <p class='speak apollo'>Apollo: I'm confused.</p>
                    <p class='speak pel'>Pel: Hey! Why does it work only when you press it!?</p>
                    <p class='speak dusty'>Dusty: Did you guys really code it only so that you can make it work?</p>
                    <p class='speak apollo'>Apollo: No I swear it's not like that. Maybe it's because I pushed the button faster or something?</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>Pel took the golden slot machine out and pulled the lever on it. It span and luckily landed on 3 coins. </p>
                    <p class='speak pel'>Pel: A</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>The slot machine dropped some coins out that was worth about not more than 25 cents. </p>
                    <p class='speak tarda'>Tarda: I mean... It works.</p>
                    <p class='speak coy'>Coy: I don't believe the other buttons don't work. I mean there are 10 buttons and there are 10 of us... Maybe it's like a person to person type of thing?</p>
                    <p class='speak joseph'>Joseph: Do you really think the machine can know who is pressing what button? Or whoever made it in the first place made it for us? It's a bit of a reach.</p>
                    <p class='speak coy'>Coy: Joseph, the machine fell from the sky and can create magic items. I don't think my theory is that strange. </p>
                    <p class='speak aegis'>Aegis: Okay guys the only way to know is to test it out. </p>
                    <p class='speak tarda'>Tarda: Assuming the sun symbol is Apollo, and that mine is one of the green beyblades that leaves the other 8. Who wants to give it a go?</p>
                    <p class='speak alp'>Alp: I wanna, I wanna! Please let me do one I have an idea.</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>Tarda sat back down to his laptop and gave Alp a look that entailed that he was ready to type in the prompt.</p>
                    <p class='speak alp'>Alp: Do... Scelidosaurus.</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>Tarda typed in. </p>
                    <p class='storytext'>PROMPT: SCELIDOSAURUS</p>
                    <p class='speak tarda'>Tarda: Okay now press all the buttons one by one and let's see if this works.</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>Alp slowly started pressing the buttons, first the one with some purple lines, then a red gear-looking symbol, and then the button that had a dark red slit that looked like a cut bleeding. That last one felt a little stiffer. And-</p>
