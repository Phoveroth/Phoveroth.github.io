                    <p class='storytext'>The cardboard box is opened. Aegis takes out what is inside and puts it on the table. It is a strange machine which has a bulky body and 10 wires that connect to 10 buttons with strange symbols on them.</p>
                    <p class='speak aegis'>Aegis: I theorize that it is an alien music instrument. But I couldn't figure out how to turn it on. There seems to be a lot of cables and wiring at the back side of it.</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>And there was, Tarda brought his computer over to see if he could connect the machine to it and after some digging he found a cable that seemed to match one of the ports on his laptop. Everyone gathered around to see what would open and after a moment of stillness dozens of lines of code appeared on the screen.</p>
                    <p class='speak dusty'>Dusty: So does it show how to play a song?</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>Apollo leaned in more so than everyone else with a sense of perplexity, and squinted his eyes at the code.</p>
                    <p class='speak apollo'>Apollo: This seems more complex than I thought, we might need some time to decipher what the machine can do.</p>
                    <p class='speak pel'>Pel: Ugh! We waited all day to just to end up still confused.</p>
                    <p class='speak aegis'>Aegis: Hey, I'm sure Apollo and Tarda can figure this thing out in no time.</p>
                    <p class='speak eri'>Eri: Maybe we can play some board games in the meantime?</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>Everyone around the table first shrugged then nodded and started making their way to the middle of the room where they sat down and Dusty went over to a shelf and took out a few options for board games.
                        Tarda and Apollo started working.
