                        Dusty and Eri have an unbreakable bond and are often found residing at each other's homes. 
                        Today is one of those days, with Eri staying over at Dusty's. As they await their friend's coming, 
                        they are eagarly talking about current, important, and crucial events.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="speak eri">Eri: Do you think iced tea is better? Or iced coffee? </p>
                    <p class="speak dusty">Dusty: Hmmm, iced coffee?</p>
                    <p class="speak eri">Eri: Why? </p>
                    <p class="speak dusty">Dusty: It's just better man</p>
                    <p class="speak eri">Eri: Ye </p>
                    <p class="storytext">
                        They have been close friends since they were kids, and because of their mutual interest in art they have a 
                        deeper bond when it comes to artistic expression and understanding of the visual. Dusty has a dream of working on molecular biology and genetics
                        and having art as a hobby, but Eri wants to pursue art school and make it her career. 

                        Eri puts her hand in her pocket and takes out a folded piece of paper giving it to Dusty
                    </p>
                    <p class="speak eri">Eri: Here, I made something for you </p>
                    <p class="storytext">
                        When Dusty unfolds it they see that it is a drawing of them as their future careers working together in a split office. Dusty in a lab coat working on experiments and Eri 
                        drawing beside them and making art.
                    </p>
                    <p class="speak dusty">Dusty: This is so sweet bro, come here</p>
                    <p class="storytext">
                        These words are followed by a nice hug. As the hug ends, they hear the door bell.
                    </p>
                    <p class="speak dusty">Dusty: That must be Aegis, let me go open the door</p>
                    <p class="storytext">
                        The door is opened to reveal the gentle giant that is Aegis, he is standing with a box in his hand presumably containing the weird machine he was talking about.
                    </p>
                    <p class="speak aegis">Aegis: You guys ready to go?</p>
                    <p class="speak dusty">Dusty: Not really, but we still have some time before we need to go. Wanna listen to some music and draw?</p>
                    <p class="speak aegis">Aegis: Yeah, that sounds pretty good actually</p>
