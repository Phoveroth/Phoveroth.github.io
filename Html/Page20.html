                    <p class='storytext'>The sun was slowly setting, and everybody was worn out. Apollo was still working on his notes, Dusty was about to take a nap on their floating couch. Alp was looking at his dinosaur like he was expecting it to move. Aegis blew out his candle that smelled like vanilla--which everyone was confused on how it was a magical item-- and walked over to Apollo and Tarda.</p>
                    <p class='speak aegis'>Aegis: Hey, how does this magic know what everything is?</p>
                    <p class='speak apollo'>Apollo: Huh?</p>
                    <p class='speak aegis'>Aegis: I mean like Atlas put in the prompt: cool, and it gave him sunglasses that matched his own but sizzles with lightning when he makes a sharp head turn. How did it know what cool meant.</p>
                    <p class='speak apollo'>Apollo: Yeah there is an aspect of subjectivity that we haven't figured out yet. I still haven't gotten to the philosophical analysis, because I was too busy on the practical analysis. Tarda has been looking over the code to see if anything else is there.</p>

                    <p class='storytext'>Coy was sitting on one of the chairs looking at her watch. She looked up and gave a suggestion.</p>
                    <p class='speak coy'>Coy: If it is subjective, if we put in something like "The best thing ever" would it give the best thing ever for us?</p>
                    <p class='speak aegis'></p>
                    <p class='storytext'>Tarda looked up from his laptop with an intrigued expression. </p>
                    <p class='speak tarda'>Tarda: You know that actually sounds interesting. Let's give it a go. </p>
                    <p class='storytext'>By this time everybody was listening in on that conversation because it broke the silence. Everybody tiringly gathered around the table to see what would happen. Tarda typed in.</p>
                    <p class='speak tarda'></p>
                    <p class='storytext'>PROMPT:THE BEST THING EVER</p>
                    <p class='speak eri'>Eri: I would say we all press the buttons at the same time. So it's like the best thing ever for all of us right?</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>Everyone looked around and nodded in agreement. Dusty started off the countdown.</p>
                    <p class='speak dusty'>3!</p>
                    <p class='speak aegis'>2!</p>
