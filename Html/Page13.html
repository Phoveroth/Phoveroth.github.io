                    <p class='storytext'>Apollo with a full grin turned over the laptop so that everybody could see... The incomprehensible lines of code...?</p>
                    <p class='speak dusty'>Dusty: Bro, I think you're forgetting not all of us speak "Tarda"</p>
                    <p class='speak tarda'>Tarda: Here, give me that.</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>Tarda took the laptop out of Apollo's hand and pointed a finger at a spesific line of code that read:
                    </p>
                    <p class='storytext'>PROMPT: BOARD GAME</p>
                    <p class='speak tarda'>Tarda: This machine can create items! And not just any item... it seems that it can create... magic items!... We think... </p>

                    <p class='storytext'>Tarda turned the laptop around and typed in...</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>PROMPT: MONEY</p>
                    <p class='speak pel'>Pel: Okay now which button do I press? Let me guess, is it the weird green spinning beyblade? Well... There is two of them but im sure one of them work.</p>
                    <p class='speak apollo'>Apollo: Well that's the thing. We don't really think all the buttons work. So far I think the only one that worked is pressing that green beyblade and the sun symbol buttons at the same time. So try those?</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>Pel walked up tot the machine and hesitantly pushed on the 2 buttons. Everyone shied away expecting a beam of light and... Nothing happened.</p>
                    <p class='speak pel'>Pel: UGH! I knew money wouldn't work, I guess the machine just knows smart people like me would exploit it and has it's boundries.</p>
                    <p class='speak apollo'>Apollo: Huh... Maybe it's random let me-</p>
                    <p class='storytext'>Apollo pushed on the button with the sun symbol on it.</p>
